## Setup

First, you will need to setup a scene that supports VRTK and Oculus Quest. You can take a look at the OVR Camera Rig and Traced Alias provided in the sameple scene.

Once VRTK is succesfully linked to the OVR Camera Rig, you can drop the included Input Manager into your scene. You will then need to assign the corresponding GameObjects to both the Touch COntrollers script and Hands Controller script, which can be found from the OVR Camera Rig.
